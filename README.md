     Welcome to the GitHub User Directory - your portal to explore and discover GitHub users along with their followers and repositories!

Our application offers a user-friendly interface that allows you to search for GitHub profiles using usernames. Once a profile is found, the app presents a detailed view including the user's avatar, bio, and a comprehensive list of their public repositories. Additionally, you can delve into the user's network by viewing a list of their followers, making it easier to explore community connections and collaborations.
